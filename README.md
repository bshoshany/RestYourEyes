# RestYourEyes

This is a very simple [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script to remind you to rest your eyes. Every 20 minutes, a notification will be displayed:

* Click "Yes" to play two beeps at 10-second intervals. Close your eyes until you hear the first beep, and then focus on a far away object until you hear the second beep.
* Click "No" to close this notification. It will also close automatically if no button is pressed within 20 seconds.
* Click "Cancel" to disable these notifications for 1 hour. Otherwise, another notification will appear in 20 minutes.

Closing your eyes for 10 seconds may help with dryness, and focusing on a far away object for 10 seconds may help with eye strain due to focusing fatigue.

To run the script automatically on startup, create a shortcut in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`.
